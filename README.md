## [Project Judging (First Round)](#project-judging-first-round)
Your project will be judged across the following categories with the corresponding weight:

|  Category      | Weight |
| :------------- | :----: |
| Implementation | 15     |
| Creativity     | 10     |

| Impact         | 10     |
| X-Factor       | 5      |

[Complete Rubric](https://github.com/CharlestonDigitalHubHackathon/General-Info/blob/master/Rubric.pdf)

Four rooms will be assigned for judging (see map to find rooms):

| Room          | Goal                             |
| :-----------: | :------------------------------: |
| Peanut Butter | Quality Education                |
| Dev/Null      | Affordable & Clean Energy        |
| Situation     | Climate Action                   |
| Eggs          | Sustainable Cities & Communities |

Outside of each room will be a schedule of when each team is assigned for judging. Generally, the number postfixed to your team name represents where your slot is in the schedule. 

Teams will have 3 minutes to demo working code, followed by a 2 minute Q&A session with the judges. 

## [Best in Show Judging (Second Round)](#best-in-show-judging-second-round)
If your project wins the first round, your project will move onto the second round to determine best in show. This round will pit the winning project across the four categories against eachother in front of a panel of judges with a variety of experiences and backgrounds.

While the final round judges will have seen the rubric, we are asking them to consider each project using their backgrounds and insights to determine the one that best solves the issue at heart for the Sustainable Development Goal.

## [Database Backups](#database-backups)

### [Restoring a Database using recommended database tool](#restoring-a-database-using-recommended-database-tool)

Download [DBeaver Community](https://dbeaver.io/download/) (supported on Mac, Windows, multi SQL variants). 

If you have already connected to your SQL instance and have your database(s) created already, you can restore a database via: right clicking the target database navigating to `Tools > Restore database`, and choosing the database backup file corresponding to the target database.

 If you haven't connected to your SQL instance and have not created your database(s) already, follow the steps below.

### [Restoring a Database using command line](#restoring-a-database-using-command-line)
 
> __NOTE__: This assumes you have not configured your machine locally with your SQL of choice or any database backups

#### MySQL
This procedure explains how to install and configure [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) locally for database backups using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on macOS 

##### 1. Install Homebrew
Installing Homebrew via opening Terminal and entering :  
 `$  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
 
##### 2. Install MySQL
At this time of writing, Homebrew has MySQL version **8.0.15** as default formulae in its main repository :

Enter the following command : `$ brew info mysql`  
> Expected output: **mysql: stable 8.0.15 (bottled)**

To install MySQL enter : `$ brew install mysql`

##### 3. Start MySQL

Start your local MySQL instance via: `mysql.server start`
> Expected output: 
>```
>Starting MySQL
> SUCCESS!
> ```
##### 4. Login to MySQL
Login as a root user to MySQL via: `mysql -uroot`
> Expected output:
> ```
> Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
>Your MySQL connection id is 9
>Server version: 8.0.15 Homebrew

##### 5. Restore a MySQL database

1. Within the mysql prompt, to restore a MySQL database, first create the target database in the backup file via:

	`create database <NAME-OF-DATABASE-IN-BACKUP-FILE>;`
	> For example, if the name of the database in the backup file was `international_energy_statistics`,  the mysql prompt would look like so:
	> 
	> ```mysql> create database international_energy_statistics;```
3.  Exit the prompt via `command` + `D`, then execute the following to restore the database: 

	`mysql -uroot <NAME-OF-DATABASE-IN-BACKUP-FILE> <NAME-OF-BACKUP-FILE>.sql`
	> For example, if the name of the database in the backup file was `international_energy_statistics` and the name of the backup is `international_energy_statistics_mysql.sql`,  the correct command would be: 
	`mysql -uroot international_energy_statistics < international_energy_statistics_mysql.sql`
